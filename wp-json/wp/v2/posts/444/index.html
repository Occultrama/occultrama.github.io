A masterpiece of metaphysical Science fiction made by a mad scientist of  dubious provenance, claiming to belong to the scientific breed, the Ofites. A Nephilim (half human\/half demon) who called himself Dr. Joseph H. Stanislaw.   During his imperceptible earthly passage (1888-1944) Dr. Stanislaw  applied the theories of the Kabbalah and Spiritualism in the  investigation of \u201cHuman Mental Projection\u201d and designed his own devices  to print and reproduce onto \u201cEktoplasmic film\u201d the images created by the spheres of mind.  In 1965 at Kresty prison in Leningrad  the compendium of a terrestrial lifetime devoted to scientific research  and painstaking experimentation was unearthed \u2026 Encrypted from within  12 vinyl discs printed with stroboscopic images and hypnotic sounds,  labeled &#8220;HK320&#8221;  Studies to date in the field using this enigmatic technology so called  \u201cEktoplasmica\u201d have given us greater opportunity to fully decipher the  Russians discs, and decompress their content in crystal-clear quality. A  compilation of six films originally written in Enochian language by the  eminent scientist.  The films have been translated and restored by O.N.E subverting the elements of experimental and re-appropiation. Those scenes too significantly damaged have been reedited with archive footage, in order to unify and complete the film symphony of Dr. Stanislaw.
