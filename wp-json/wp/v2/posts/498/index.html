A disembodied being talks us through the streets of a coastal town. Moving between people\u2019s feelings, dreams, and mindscapes, the spirit relentlessly looks for his double among the city inhabitants. Tau is a docu-fiction portrait of a city, Tarragona, as seen through the \u201ceyes\u201d of a daemon who dwells in a parallel, and yet close to ours, reality. The story takes place somewhere between the contemporary world and the ancient times of myths, spirits, and daemons. The film also explores cultural archetypes showing the eternal conflict between centralized and decentralized structures, between pyramids and networks.<\/p>\n<p>Director: Gerard Gil Fargas<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tau is, at once, a fiction film on spirits, a documentary on the passing of time in a small town and a portrait of Catalan traditional culture.
