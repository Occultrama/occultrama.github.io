At this time in his life, LaVey was seeing only a select few people. For this film, I&#8217;ve met and interviewed some of them, to try and create a composite image of what he was really like, and what he meant to these people. It&#8217;s a memory lane trip, filled with personal stories, dark humor, great music and never before seen material with the &#8220;Black Pope&#8221; himself. \u2013 Carl Abrahamsson<br>\n\nAnton LaVey was many things to many people: musician, magician, writer, wild animal trainer, police photographer, film buff, founder of a magical group, and possibly of a new religion, and yes\u2026 He was a Satanist. With his creation of the infamous Church of Satan in 1966, and his bestselling book The Satanic Bible in 1969, Anton LaVey changed the ballgame in many ways. Here was a free-spirited San Francisco based group neither in favour of mind-expanding drugs, nor of peace &amp; love for its own sake. Here was a group that was decidedly, outspokenly anti-Christian. Here was a group that brought dark pro-sexual psychodrama and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche straight into American living rooms and TV couches. Anton LaVey became a celebrity scapegoat who basked in the attention, and made a successful career out of it. But who was Anton LaVey behind the public persona that so easily provoked primitive American Christians and other intolerants? Who was this enigmatic \u201cAmerican Adversary\u201d?<br>\n\nThis film contains never before shown interview material with LaVey, private photographs, and rare recordings, plus in-depth interviews with Blanche Barton, Peter Gilmore, Peggy Nadramia, Bob Johnson, Kenneth Anger, Michael Moynihan, Mitch Horowitz, Ruth Waytz, Larry Wessel, Margie Bauer, Jack Stevenson, and Jim Morton.<\/p>\n<p>Cast: Blanche Barton, Peter Gilmore, Peggy Nadramia, Bob Johnson, Kenneth Anger, Michael Moynihan, Mitch Horowitz, Ruth Waytz, Larry Wessel, Margie Bauer, Jack Stevenson, Jim Morton<\/p>\n<p>Director: Carl Abrahamsson<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1989, I met Anton LaVey for the first time.
