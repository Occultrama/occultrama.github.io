Since her mother\u2019s passing, no one has ever crossed the gate of their property. Nobody has left or entered. They live in a world in which every sign of life has to be suppressed and inhibited. Life is a source of pain, attachments and affections induce sorrow and this evil has to be avoided. But now something new has started to grow inside Evelin. Something that cannot be pushed away. Her body has awakened and has no intention to be bunked down again. In the meantime, the blossoming spring has started and a young man, called by everyone the idiot, has decided to abandon his land, looking for the woman he met in his dreams. The story was inspired by the book \u201cMore Than Human\u201d by Theodore Sturgeon  Like a stone in a peach, a yolk in an egg, he carried another thing. It was passive, it was receptive, it was awake and alive. If it was connected in any way to the animal integument, it ignored the connexions. It drew its substance from the idiot and was otherwise unaware of him.<\/p>\n<p>Cast: Adriana Grigoriev, Marta Suardi, Niccol\u00f2 Tiberi, Mino Francesco Manni<\/p>\n<p>Director: Seth Morley<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Evelin lives with her sister Alice and her Father in an isolated cottage along the river.
